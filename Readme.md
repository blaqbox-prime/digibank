# DigiBank Mobile Banking App
This project is a mobile banking app project that I am building for my portfolio. I realize although I have made a few mobile apps in the past I don't really have a good project for a portfolio specifically under mobile development so this project I intend to make as comprehensive as possible, covering all bases and documenting the processðŸ¤“ 

## Project Description:
