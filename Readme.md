# DigiBank Mobile Banking App
This project is a mobile banking app project that I am building for my portfolio. I realize although I have made a few mobile apps in the past I don't really have a good project for a portfolio specifically under mobile development so this project I intend to make as comprehensive as possible, covering all bases and documenting the processðŸ¤“ 

## Project Description:

In this case study, we will delve into the development of a state-of-the-art banking app aimed at providing customers with a seamless, secure, and user-friendly banking experience. The app will allow users to perform a wide range of financial transactions, manage their accounts, and access essential banking services right from their mobile devices.

## Requirements

1. **User Authentication:**

   * Users should be able to register and log in using email or phone numbers.
   * Implement biometric authentication (fingerprint or face recognition) for enhanced security.

2. **Account Management:**

   * Display account balances, transaction history, and recent activities.
   * Allow users to update their contact information and preferences.
   * Enable users to open new accounts within the app.

3. **Fund Transfers:**

    * Facilitate internal transfers between the user's accounts.
    * Enable external transfers to other bank accounts via ACH or wire transfers.
    * Implement a beneficiary management system for easy and secure transfers.

4. **Bill Payments:**

    * Allow users to pay bills by linking their accounts or credit/debit cards.
    * Provide a list of predefined billers and the option to add custom billers.
    * Send notifications for upcoming bills and successful payments.

5. **Account Statements:**

    * Provide access to downloadable PDF account statements.
    * Offer filters and search options for specific transactions.

6. **Customer Support:**

    * Include an in-app messaging system for customer support inquiries.
    * Provide a FAQ section addressing common issues.

7. **Security Measures:**

    * Use end-to-end encryption for all communication between the app and server.
    * Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive transactions.
    * Monitor and detect unusual activities to prevent unauthorized access.
